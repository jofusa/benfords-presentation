You need a web server to run. Or some fancy browsers will server up the content alone.

git this folder. cd ./Benfords/
Don't think you have a server? well your wrong use the power of python

run:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

This will start a server at localhost:8000

Get an error about port in use. change port like:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8002
